# RADXIDE
One more IDE but thought for RAD.

<br>
Originally envisioned for RAD development in PHP...
<br><br>
The software checks for the existance of the Working Dir
in /home/YourUser/.radxwork.

The "Code Library" of the window right pane needs the 
folder $dan(WORKDIR)/.snippets eg:<br> 
<br> 
/home/YourUser/.radxwork/.snippets<br><br>
and must be filled with your examples files tagged with 
one [tag] on their names and containg a first line of 
#comment to give a the menu a descriptive nomenclature:<br>
<br>
~/.radxwork/.snippets/file[php].inc:<br>
#Example of PHP code<br>
phpinfo();<br>
<br>
Please see "examples/_snippets"
